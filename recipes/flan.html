            <h2>What is Flan?</h2>
            <p>Flan, or <i>crème caramel</i>, is a creamy custard dessert topped with caramel that&apos;s popular in Mexico, Spain, and many Latin American countries.</p>
            <p>It&apos;s known for its smooth and creamy consistency that&apos;s achieved by cooking the custard in a water bath, or a <i>bain-marie</i> or <i>baño-maría</i>. Doing so creates steam in the oven that gently and evenly cooks the flan, keeping it moist and ensuring that the eggs aren&apos;t overcooked, curdled, or scrambled.</p>
            <p>The flan is cooked with the caramel on the bottom of the pan and the custard mixture on top. After it&apos;s cooked and sufficiently cooled, the flan is then inverted onto a plate to reveal a rich and golden caramel sauce that perfectly covers the top of the flan!</p>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <p><b>Cooking</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Make the caramel by pouring the sugar into a warm skillet over medium heat. Keep stirring the sugar while it heats up and begins to brown and clump together. Continue stirring until the sugar completely dissolves and melts into a beautiful golden-brown caramel!</p></li>
                <li><p>Carefully pour the caramel into the bottom of the flanera or cake pan as evenly as possible. Try to work quickly because the caramel will start to harden in a matter of seconds after it&apos;s hit the bottom of the pan. Also, be sure to use a towel or oven mitts as the bottom of the pan will be very hot. Try to distribute the caramel evenly into the pan. If it hardens too quickly and you aren&apos;t to do so, you can carefully heat the pan up by placing it directly on the stove or on the skillet. That will loosen up the hardened caramel a bit so it can flow into the areas you need it to go.</p></li>
                <li><p>Set the caramel aside and let it cool so it hardens a bit. While it&apos;s cooling, whisk together the eggs, sweetened condensed milk, whole milk, and vanilla extract. Whisk until everything is evenly incorporated but try not to over-whisk so you don&apos;t get too many air bubbles in the mixture.</p></li>
                <li><p>Pour the custard mixture into the hardened caramel-lined pan.</p></li>
                <li><p>Cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil, or secure it with a lid if you&apos;re using a flanera.</p></li>
                <li><p>Place the pan in a large baking dish and fill the baking dish with water until it reaches halfway up the flan pan. Bake the flan for 1 hour and 15 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit or 180 degrees Celsius.</p></li>
                <li><p>Carefully remove the flan pan from the water bath, remove the lid, and let it cool to room temperature. Then place it in the refrigerator and chill for 4 hours or overnight.
                </p></li>
            </ol>

            <p><b>Serving</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li><p>When you&apos;re ready to eat it, remove the lid or aluminum foil from the pan and gently slide a knife along the edges of the pan to loosen it up a bit.</p></li>
                <li><p>Place a large plate or platter over the pan and quickly and carefully flip over the pan and the plate so that the flan is upside down. Pull up the flan pan &hyphen; if the flan doesn&apos;t slide out immediately, place the pan down and let it sit for a bit. It will slide out so don&apos;t freak out! Give the sides of the pan a tap or some squeezes and see if that helps.</p></li>
            </ol>
